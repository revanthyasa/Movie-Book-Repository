# Movie-Book-Repository
This full-stack web application is designed for managing a collection of movies and books, utilizing a .NET Core Web API for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend is powered by Entity Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database, providing endpoints for CRUD operations on movie and book records. JWT-based authentication secures the API, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify data. The frontend, built with React, uses Axios to communicate with the backend and manage state with React Hooks (useState, useEffect). Users can add, update, and delete movie and book records via intuitive forms, with validation in place to ensure data integrity. The application is designed for efficient data flow between the client and server, with smooth integration of JWT tokens for authentication.
